# codeforces templates and algorithims 

### Contest 
Start a new self-contained session with `./build`. This starts an interactive bash shell in a temporary docker container with the problems loaded into vim.  

Resume into vim with all problems loaded using `./init` if you exit (ommiting `--write`). <br>
Resume into vim with all templates loaded from scratch with `./init --write` if you exit.


Compile and run with `cin` by using `F9`. 

Exiting from the bash shell will automatically destroy the docker container.
